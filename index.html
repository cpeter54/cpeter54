									<h2>Education Background</h2>
									<p>Currently, I am attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville to earn my undergraduate degree in GIST. 
										I first heard about the program here through the connections I made during my time in high school. 
										Here, I have expanded my understanding of GIS software and am actively striving towards key specialization and skill proficiency. 
										It is my goal to eventually use the abilities I have built here to continue my education into graduate school.</p>

									<p>Not only has my undergraduate time been educational, but it also has proven to be one of the best avenues for networking. 
										My professors have introduced me to various professionals in this field and I have been given the opportunity to work under some of them. 
										I plan on using my coursework and connections to bolster my knowledge and set myself apart as the perfect candidate to enter this profession.</p>
